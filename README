These makefiles are supposed to be very generic.
They are handwritten so they are readable!
  (Althought they could be easier to read.)

Currently supported stuff:
  Internationalisation with gettext
  C programs and C libraries
  Texinfo manual (although only one, and no translations)
  Man pages, with translations.
  auto-auto-complete scripts.
  ... other things that you really do not want to care about.
