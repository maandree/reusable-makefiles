Include the mk/ dir into your repository
and follow the instructions.

This makefiles are support to be very generic.
They are handwritten so they are readable!
  (Althought they could be easier to read.)

Currently support stuff:
  Internationalisation with gettext
  C programs (not libraries get)
  Texinfo manual (although only one, and no translations)
  Man pages, with translations.
  ... other things that you really do want to care about
